        <h3>Poseidon Part 3</h3>
        <h4>This is the last part!</h4>
        <p>Athena created an olive tree that would provide food supply and shade.</p>
        <p>The people of Athens were happy but didn't want to tell Poseidon he lost.</p>
        <p>Amazingly, Poseidon said that Athena was the winner and slipped back into the sea where he was worshipped by everyone.</p>
