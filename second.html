        <h1 style = "background-color: khaki;">Poseidon Part 2</h1>
        <p>He told the people of Athens that he'd protect them and that he should be the one who the temple was built for.</p>
        <p>Athena, the goddess of war did the same exact thing.</p>
        <p>The people couldn't decide and new that they didn't want to get involved in the fight between the gods. Athena said they should compete.</p>
        <p>Poseidon went first and struck his trident and created a beautiful river. The people were happy, but it turned out that the water was salty water. It was disgusting. What do you think Athena created?</p>
